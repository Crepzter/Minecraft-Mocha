A little file for other mod/modpack creators to see, what aspects of the vanilla code my mod actually changes

Jeb_ Sheeps (all only run if named "jeb_"):

	-on kill:
		-GlobalLootModifier -> removes wool from generated loot and replaces it with correctly coloured wool
	-on player shear:
		-PlayerInteractEvent.EntityInteract -> cancels original event, spawns correct wool and plays sound...
	-on dispenser shear:
		-ShearsDispenseItemBehavior -> runs custom Sheep#shear for correct color, damages stack and plays sound...

# Minecraft Mocha

My attempt to create a lightweight and compatible mod, that adds simple, yet impactful, features to minecraft the community is missing currently.

Refer to implementations.txt to see how each feature is accomplished.

Current Features are:

-"Jeb_" named sheeps drop wool accordingly to their current color

-The fletching table now got its own craftingmenu to craft arrows more efficiently
